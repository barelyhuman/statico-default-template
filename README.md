# statico default template

The simplest template for [statico](https://github.com/barelyhuman/statico);

### Design

The template is heavily inspired from [https://blog.matsu.io/](https://blog.matsu.io/) and keeps itself as simple as possible, it uses the least amount of css and can be used as is with minor modifications to the `config.yml`

### Usage

To use the template, simply clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/barelyhuman/statico-default-template # clone
cd statico-default-template # move into the directory
rm -rf .git # remove existing git objects
git init # re-init git as a fresh instance (if you want to use git for versioning)
```

Then, make sure you have `statico` installed in you `PATH` and you can just run it in either `watch` mode or `watch` and `serve` mode to check out the template.
